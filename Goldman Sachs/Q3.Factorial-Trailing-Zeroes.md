#  Factorial Trailing Zeroes

[![Problem Link](https://img.shields.io/badge/-LeetCode-FFA116?style=for-the-badge&logo=LeetCode&logoColor=black)](https://leetcode.com/problems/factorial-trailing-zeroes/)


O(log_5(N)) (base 5!) is faster than any polynomial. You need no more than 14 iterations to get the result. You just need to count how many times 5 appears in n! during multiplication in different forms: 5, 25, 125, 625, ... . when any 5 is multiplied by 2 (we have many of them) then we get 0 at the end. That's it.

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
       int result =0;
        while(n > 0){
            n /= 5;
            result += n;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
